## To connect a Secoda to a Slack

1. We recommend you create a separate channel for Secoda purposes (i.e. #secoda-notifications), since you'll also receive notifications if there are things like schema changes or documentation edits there.

2. After this channel is created or you've decided which channel you'd like to use, go to **Settings** in the Secoda App.

3. Go to **Slack** from the settings menu.

4. Click **Add to Slack** and choose the channel that you'd like to receive notifications in.
