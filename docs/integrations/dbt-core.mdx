## **Getting Started with dbt Core**

dbt is a secondary integration that adds additional metadata on to your data
warehouse or relational database tables. Before connecting dbt make sure to
connect a data warehouse or relational database first. These include Snowflake,
BigQuery, Postgres, Redshift, etc.

There are three options to connect dbt core with Secoda:

1. Upload a manifest.json

2. Connect an AWS S3 bucket

3. Secoda API

#### Upload manifest.json

This is a one time sync with your manifest.json file. You can upload the file
following these steps:

1. Navigate to https://app.secoda.co/integrations/new

2. Click "dbt Core"

3. Select your manifest.json file using the file selector

4. Click "Test Connection"

5. Click "Submit"

After clicking submit an extraction will run to sync the metadata from the
uploaded manifest.json.

**Connect an AWS S3 bucket**

If you upload your manifest.json files to an AWS S3 bucket, you can connect that
bucket to Secoda which will run a daily extraction to sync the latest
manifest.json files. Only files from the bucket that contain `manifest.json` in
the name will be synced to Secoda. You can connect the bucket following these
steps:

Create a new AWS IAM user and ensure that **Access Key - Programatic access is
checked.** Once you create the user save the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key
that are generated for the user.

Attach the following policy to the user. Make sure to change

```json
<your-bucket-name>.

{

"Statement": \[

{

"Action": \[

"s3:PutObject",

"s3:PutObjectAcl",

"s3:ListBucket",

"s3:GetObject",

"s3:GetObjectAcl",

"s3:DeleteObject"

\],

"Effect": "Allow",

"Resource": \[

"arn:aws:s3:::<your-bucket-name>",

"arn:aws:s3:::<your-bucket-name>/\*"

\]

}

\],

"Version": "2012-10-17"

}
```

Connect your S3 bucket to Secoda

1.  Navigate to https://app.secoda.co/integrations/new

2.  2.  Click "dbt Core"

3.  3.  Add the credentials that you've saved from AWS

    - Region
    - Bucket Name
    - Access Key ID
    - Secret Access Key

4.  4.  Click "Test Connection"

5.  5.  Click "Submit"

After clicking submit an extraction will run to sync the metadata from the
manifest.json files in the S3 bucket that you've connected.

**Secoda API**

The API provides an endpoint to upload your manifest.json file. This is
convenient if you run dbt with Airflow because you can upload the manifest.json
at the end of a dbt run. Follow these instructions to upload your manifest.json
via the API:

1. Create a blank dbt core integration by going to
   https://app.secoda.co/integrations/new and selecting the "dbt Core"
   integration and then click "Test Connection". And run the initial extraction.
   This extraction will fail, but that's intended.

2. Return to https://app.secoda.co/integrations and click on the dbt Core
   integration that was just created. Save the ID which is contained in the URL.

3. Follow the example in our
   [API docs](https://docs.secoda.co/secoda-api/dbt-integration) to upload a
   manifest.json file using the integration ID you created.
