## In Secoda, you can create custom invitation links

Determined by role and group. This ensures that people who join do so with the correct permissions and access. It also makes inviting large groups of people easier. 

To do this, go to **Settings**, and then click **Members**. From here, go to **Invitation Links.** 

This is where you can manage invites to your Secoda workspace. You can also manage the roles for each group. Delete invitation links by clicking the three dots on the right.
