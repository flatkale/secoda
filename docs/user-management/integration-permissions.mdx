## **Everything about to managing** Permissions **for Integrations**

To start, go to Integrations from the left navigation bar. 

From here, click on the Integration you'd like to edit the permissions for.

You'll see a number of tabs underneath the integration name. Click on Permissions. 

On this page, you'll be able to see all of the users you've added to the integration. You can select all of the users you'd like to have query permissions, and de-select those you would not.
