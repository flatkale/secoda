### Ask Questions from Slack

First, youâ€™ll need to connect Secoda to your Slack workspace following these instructions. 

After youâ€™ve done so, anyone in your Slack workspace can ask a question using a Slack command: `/ask,` followed by their question.

From here, you'll be prompted to ask your question and submit information to follow up. If you're an admin, if you make a [question template](/features/data-requests/templates) the default, the template will show up on this Slack question form.
