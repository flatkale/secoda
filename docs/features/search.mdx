## Secoda Search

You can search for terms in plain language, or by the table name and data source if you already know what you're looking for.

## Nav Search

Click on different tabs below the search bar to see results from a specific data source. For example, if you're looking for a Mode dashboard, you can use the side nav to filter by a table, source, schema or folder that you want to view in the data folder.
