## **How to manage collections in Secoda**

You can create Collections on Secoda which allows you to group various resources together and document them. Collections are a revamped version of the tags, so the mechanism for adding a resource to a collection is that same as tagging. You can also pin collections to the home page for easier discoverability. 

We recommend creating collections per team, group, or function. For example, a "Marketing" collection, or a "Finance" collection.
