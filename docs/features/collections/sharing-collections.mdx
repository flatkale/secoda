## **How to share collections in Secoda**

To share a collection with someone, go to the Collections page and then select the one that you'd like to share. 

Click on the three dots on the top right side of the collection. From there, you'll be able to see who currently is shared on the collection, and be able to add more people to it.

You can also copy a link to the collection from this view. You can invite individuals to share with, or with groups that you've made in Secoda (i.e. only sharing with the engineering team). 

#### Share outside your team

You can invite people from outside your workspace to join as guests. 

**Quick instructions for sharing with guests:**

* Click the `Add Users and Groups` button and add the people you want using their email addresses.

* Whoever you invite this way will receive an email with a link to the resource you've invited them to view or edit.

* If you want to see all the guests in your workspace and the resources they have permission to access, go to the `Members` section of `Settings & Members` and go to the `Users` tab.

* In this same window, you can remove guests from your workspace, change their access levels, or convert them to full members.

* Click on `Share` at the top right of the resource, and switch off access for your workspace, individuals, groups, or the public.

* For guests, click `Share` and then select `Remove` from the dropdown next to their names. You can also go to `Settings & Members`, scroll down to find the guests you want, click on the dropdown to the right of their names and click the `Remove` button.

If you have full access to a resource, you can disable sharing with anyone at any time.

#### Stop sharing

If you have full access to a resource, you can disable sharing with anyone at any time.

* Click on `Share` at the top right of the resource, and switch off access for your workspace, individuals, groups, or the public.

* For guests, click `Share` and then select `Remove` from the dropdown next to their names. You can also go to `Settings & Members`, scroll down to find the guests you want, click on the dropdown to the right of their names and click the `Remove` button.
