## How to Add Properties to a Doc

To create a custom property in a document, click **Add a Property**, below the static fields in the document. 

Enter the name for the property and the description/label. This custom property will only apply to the current document that you're editing.

To delete a custom property, click on the name of the property, then click **Delete**.

Custom properties can be used to identify alternative names for terms or collections. These properties will get picked up in the search. 

If you have a term like "MRR" adding a custom property called "Also known as" and adding all the alternative names of a term will index those names when someone searches for "monthly reccuring revenue" or "monthly sales"
