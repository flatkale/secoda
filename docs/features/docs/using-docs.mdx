## How to Use Docs in Secoda

Docs are like a Notion document with live queries and charts. You can reference your data catalogue and data dictionary while creating robust data analysis in Secoda. 

Analysis documents are useful once you've connected your database to Secoda and given Secoda permission to query the data in the database. After you've done this, you can open the analysis document to view a blank page that looks like the picture below

This document allows you to add query blocks, text blocks, embeds, files, charting and anything else you can think of to document your analysis from one place. To add a new block, press the `/ `command and press on the block that you want to add to the document.

Query blocks allow editors to query the data directly from Secoda. You can add a text block to add additional information before or after the query in case someone wants to understand how they can better use the query. The query editor is flexible and allows viewers to export the results, expand the query, hide the query, filter the results and choose which database to query. To insert a query block, type `/query`

Documents can be shared with any employee and can be indexed by the central search.
