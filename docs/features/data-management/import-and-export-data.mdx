Once you are ready to upload your new descriptions, you can use the import descriptions button to upload your new CSV into Secoda.

If you have set up a documentation tool at your organization you can migrate your descriptions to Secoda following these steps.

1. Export descriptions to a CSV.

2. Upload descriptions to Secoda.

3. Verify descriptions.

#### 1\. Export descriptions to a CSV

The import functionality only supports tables and columns currently. The CSV must have the following structure:

**Table Name**

**Field Name**

**Description**

**Custom Property**

name_1

column_1

description_1

custom_1

name_2

column_2

description_2

custom_2

If you'd like to just import table descriptions and properties, the "Field Name" column is not required.

#### 2\. Upload descriptions to Secoda

Log into [Secoda](https://app.secoda.co) and go into the **Settings > Data.** Create a backup of your current descriptions, if you'd like, by clicking "Export". \*\*\*\* Click the "**Import**" button and select the `.csv` file you exported in step 1, and wait for the success message.

#### 3\. Verify descriptions
