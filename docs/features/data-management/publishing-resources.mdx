## **Getting Started with Publishing in Secoda**

You can draft various resources in Secoda (dictionary terms, collections, documents, questions) and leave them as a draft before publishing. To do this, select **Draft** to the right of the resource description fields. 

**As a draft, only the editor and workspace admins are able to view the resource.** To make a resource viewable to guests and viewers, select **Publish** within the same dropdown as **Draft.** 

You can change resources to Published or Drafted simply by toggling between the two. Published resources can be changed back into Drafts.

This is useful for workspace admins and editors to create resources and have internal reviews before publishing for the entire workspace.
